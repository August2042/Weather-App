 # Weather-App

 A simple Flutter weather application that uses OpenWeatherMap to fetch current weather data and demonstrates state management with Riverpod.

 This README explains how to set up, run, and contribute to the project.

 ## Features

 - Fetch current weather and basic forecasts from OpenWeatherMap.
 - Uses `flutter_riverpod` for state management.
 - Makes HTTP requests using the `http` package.

 ## Prerequisites

 - Flutter SDK (project specifies Dart SDK constraint ^3.9.2 in `pubspec.yaml`).
 - An Android/iOS device or emulator, or desktop/web support configured for your Flutter installation.
 - An OpenWeatherMap API key (free to get at https://openweathermap.org/api).

 ## Setup

 1. Clone the repository and open it in your editor:

    git clone <repo-url>
    cd Weather-App

 2. Install dependencies:

    flutter pub get

 3. Provide your OpenWeatherMap API key. The app expects the key to be available at runtime. Common approaches:

    - Add it to a `.env` or secret management solution and load at runtime.
    - For quick local testing, you can create a file `lib/secrets.dart` (gitignored) with:

 ```dart
 // lib/secrets.dart
 const String openWeatherMapApiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
 ```

 4. (Optional) Enable platforms you need (e.g., Android, iOS, web, Windows):

    flutter config --enable-web

 ## Run

 - Run on connected device / emulator:

   flutter run

 - Run for a specific platform (e.g., chrome):

   flutter run -d chrome

 - Build release APK (Android):

   flutter build apk --release

 ## Tests

 Run the unit/widget tests with:

   flutter test

 ## Linting

 This project includes `flutter_lints`. Run the analyzer with:

   flutter analyze

 ## Project structure

 - `lib/` - main application code. Entry point: `lib/main.dart`.
 - `test/` - unit and widget tests.
 - `pubspec.yaml` - dependencies and SDK constraints.

 ## Environment & Dependencies

 Key dependencies from `pubspec.yaml`:

 - Flutter SDK
 - cupertino_icons
 - http
 - flutter_riverpod

 SDK constraint: `environment: sdk: ^3.9.2` (see `pubspec.yaml`).

 ## Contributing

 If you'd like to contribute:

 1. Fork the repository.
 2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`.
 3. Make changes and add tests where applicable.
 4. Open a pull request with a clear description of changes.

 ## Troubleshooting

 - If you get dependency errors, run `flutter pub get` and ensure your Flutter SDK is up to date.
 - If the app can't reach the weather API, verify your API key and network connectivity.
